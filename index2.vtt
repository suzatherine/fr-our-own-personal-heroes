00:00:00.015 --> 00:00:05.645
[audio playing...]

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.270
Of course, I was born an artist. This is

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.340
what was given to me and I cannot

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.520
refuse. But I live with just an ordinary

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.550
life trying to find the chance to earn

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.570
something, to spend some. I was the same

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.980
swine as everyone else. Well, in

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.160
Donetsk, I lived in that context. We

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.260
understood that we lived in Feudal,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.410
corrupted sociology. And everyone looked

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.920
for the own comfort zone. There was no

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.185
feeling that anything needed to change.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.680
But during the mind down in 2014, I was

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.160
amazed. Because finally, something real

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.330
was happening. People came out against

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.940
the state machine, and no one gave any

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.325
chance that it would not be a victory.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.740
It inspired me a lot. And I realized, so

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.110
they wanted to be in the country, so

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.280
they leave them don't yet became

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.690
occupied by rush, and its proxies. There

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.050
was no centralized power in the city,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.080
just scattered gangs, each of which

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.250
control the sorting district. At first,

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.130
I didn't fully believe that this was

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.550
permanent. But then, when I saw how

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.555
things were developing, I understood

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.470
that this was there. I had the self

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.130
realization that if I see it and do

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.710
nothing, it will torment me for the rest

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.760
of my life. I guess that my friends and

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.310
invited them to participate in creating

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.515
street art. They refused, because it was

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.410
too dangerous. But one person, a

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.660
professional photographer agreed to

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.290
help. There was neither opportunity not

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.520
time to paint on the street. So I worked

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.910
on plywood with the plan to place the

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.570
finish it works around the city. I

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.780
agreed to see goods that marked the self

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.205
proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.720
Some images contain is the literary

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.540
character sharekhan. Everyone from

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.930
Mikhail Bulgakov novel, he was dressed

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.840
in camouflage with a symbol of the so

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.800
called novel Ross, new rush. There was

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.110
the Russian military commander, he goes

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.960
through cold holding a gun to his head

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.910
with the Nike catchphrase, just do an

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.110
image of death with a grenade. There was

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.490
also a cloud. All the figures were of

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.300
human height, imitating aerial persons

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.865
size, they look like advertising boards.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.800
It was not something metaphorical, but a

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.740
direct message. I walked around the city

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.260
and choose places where they could be

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.080
placed. Whether there were no

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.430
surveillance cameras, I planned here. I

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.820
will park the car here. I will go out

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.360
through the yard. Here. I will leave the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.920
art when where my friend will take a

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.970
picture. There was a curfew at night. So

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.130
I decided that it should be in the

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.000
morning at around five o'clock. On the

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.790
first day, we drove around the city and

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.300
placed two artworks. As we drove to the

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.330
next location, two militants told us to

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.195
stop the car who was still in place.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.070
They asked where we were going. And we

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.670
said two more. There were two more

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.700
artworks in the booth. If they had

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.520
looked inside, they would have killed

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.050
us. After that, I started putting one

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.510
artwork at a time with a break of

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.040
several days or even weeks. They would

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.280
stay up for a couple of hours and then

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.720
be gone. I went around and watching the

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.990
reaction. People laughed and took

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.380
selfies. They wrote on wine saying it

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.800
was a powerful signal that normal people

00:04:44.070 --> 00:05:00.845
still live here.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.540
In total, I was kidnapped by militants

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.320
for a month and how I was kept in

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.615
basements. From the first interrogation,

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.790
I already had broken ribs. And on day

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.360
one, I experienced the first mock

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.750
execution. On the second day, the

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.050
scenario was the same. I thought that

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.980
nothing could be worse. But then they

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.620
bought another prisoner to the military

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.010
headquarters. They stuffed us through

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.530
the hedge into a military car. But it

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.730
was impossible for two people to be. It

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.120
was summer. And it was very hot in this

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.390
iron box. They had such methods of

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.890
torture. Every day, there were two mock

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.690
executions. The most terrible one was

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.810
when we were picked up at night. They

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.390
were drinking because one of them had

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.930
the best day and he wanted to shoot a

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.380
Ukraine. This battalion made money by

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.690
getting prisoners to cut cars into

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.560
metal, so they weren't us as slaves. I

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.650
was handcuffed to another person. It was

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.890
very uncomfortable. My left hand was

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.670
injured and so was the other guys. We

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.220
were bound to each other as twin

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.160
brothers. We had to pick and eat

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.130
together. There was a car which they

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.400
wanted to paint in camouflage. Someone

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.650
mentioned the diamond artist. So they

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.450
said, paint and we will let you go. I

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.660
painted they gave me a few coins and

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:54.900
clean clothes. And I was but there was

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.450
one problem. The security service can my

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.600
passport without the passport. You can't

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.120
go anywhere. So I went with my

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.790
girlfriend and they said, we released

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.780
you take him into the basement. I stayed

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.200
there for a month. This time. There were

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.160
no interrogations, no bullying. Our job

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.490
was to dig trenches. But my injuries

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.210
made this impossible. They took me to a

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.930
place called hotel lever, which before

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.630
the occupation was a popular bar with

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.620
the statues of the Beatles. We were in a

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.170
hotel room, we have the shower, and we

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.900
work in the kitchen peeling potatoes for

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:45.450
the militants that leave. I was able to

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.580
ask for a phone and I contacted my

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.950
girlfriend who work in the security

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:54.210
forces. She was given the number of some

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:58.290
boss well, such telephone numbers are

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.320
not given out to strangers. There are no

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.470
cords. Someone simply asked to release

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:12.244
me. And finally they let me go.

00:08:12.269 --> 00:08:14.699
I stayed in local Python yet for a while

00:08:15.059 --> 00:08:17.669
until I realized that there was nothing

00:08:17.669 --> 00:08:21.989
there. All I had was 500 printers. And I

00:08:21.989 --> 00:08:25.739
went to key in key of the worst seemed

00:08:25.739 --> 00:08:30.239
far away. But on February 24, I woke up

00:08:30.389 --> 00:08:33.539
and went to the workshop. I looked at

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:38.579
all the art and sought none of this is

00:08:38.579 --> 00:08:42.569
important. I just had such a breakdown

00:08:42.569 --> 00:08:45.209
questioning what have I been doing? Oh

00:08:45.209 --> 00:08:47.879
my wife. Only the art of killing

00:08:47.879 --> 00:08:51.634
Moscowitz is needed. That's it.

00:08:51.659 --> 00:08:55.919
Everything else is not art. I went to

00:08:55.919 --> 00:08:58.349
the military headquarters. It's an

00:08:58.349 --> 00:09:01.714
understandable reaction to this events.

00:09:01.739 --> 00:09:04.889
I was sent to territorial defense, but

00:09:04.889 --> 00:09:09.029
there was a long queue. And it was here

00:09:09.419 --> 00:09:12.929
that I realized that what artists do is

00:09:12.929 --> 00:09:17.189
also important. So I went back to work

00:09:17.214 --> 00:09:46.206

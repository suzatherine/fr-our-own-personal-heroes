00:00:00.015 --> 00:00:08.135
[audio playing...]

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.710
across the ages, there has always been

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.680
Russian colonialism, censorship, and

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.040
attempts to erase our culture. Imagine

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.410
losing the arts and artifacts that

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.955
represents your history, your identity

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.265
in museums in Houston and Mariupol,

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.480
there are now empty rooms where Russians

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.125
have taken everything.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.980
How would you feel to have another

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.830
country so your heritage on the two

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.100
houses in their own museums and DeRuyter

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.815
history?

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.425
Two weeks into the full scale invasion,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.610
Iraqis hit the ivantage historical and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.955
Local History Museum.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.500
Insights was the works of Maria prima

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.530
chenko. A world renowned artists could

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.260
you incarnate with natural pigments. The

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.865
museum run totally on fire. Totally.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.380
Some people from the village with just

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.930
their bare hands tried to rescue her

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.445
works. It was a total shock.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.840
I began calling different people asking

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.670
if they need help to preserve our

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.700
cultural heritage. This is how I came

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.135
into contact with Alessandro, such

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.140
researcher and curator of the factor

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.040
School of photography.

00:01:20.065 --> 00:01:37.595
[audio playing...]

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.260
The whole of January was full of this

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.290
pre escalation tension. And I had been

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.030
talking with Surya libertines key the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.980
director of the Museum of Harkey School

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.410
of photography, about how we should

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.715
prepare our collections for evacuation.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.020
We have amazing photography archives.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.180
They are not just Ukrainian heritage,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.910
but world heritage. The core of the

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.310
collection is the artwork of Harkey

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.560
School of photography. It wasn't an

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.200
institution but an informal community of

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.420
three generations of like minded

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.375
artists.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.040
It emerged in the late 1960s and

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.320
included top level photographers like

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.990
Barry's Mihaylova and his friends. If

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.600
any Pavlov Victor Cogito for a month at

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.910
golf course and his salon skin, others

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.120
whose work in the 60s 70s and 80s

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.610
expanded the borders of the medium and

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.980
demonstrated how it can overcome

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.870
censorship, trying to get through the

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.645
muteness of late Soviet epoch.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.890
On the one hand, what they were doing

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.500
was really resistance. But on the other

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.590
hand, it was not manifested or obvious.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.140
These photographers saw their practice

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.630
as a tool to carve out an alternative

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.450
space. Before the collapse of the USSR,

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.280
they had few chances to present their

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.550
works in public. For instance, the first

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.890
generation the so called Lima group,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.840
which is translated as time from

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.270
Russian, had only one exhibition

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.890
throughout the whole history of the

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.570
group, which is said to be closed in a

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.575
couple of hours after opening.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.210
So they chose to create an inner circle

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.610
of photographers, who were thinking the

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.740
same way, sharing the thoughts and

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.770
ideas. The photos from this generation

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.140
hold the phenomenon and history of this

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.075
society, their relationships and bonds.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.950
Preserving this archives was what began

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.660
the Harkey School of photography and has

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.540
become a space to unite researchers and

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.880
spotlights Ukrainian photographers from

00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:42.185
across the decades until now.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.700
When the full scale invasion began, I

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.520
had it to the west, because the priority

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.615
was the life of my family.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.800
For a week, I was just in a complete

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.280
state of Anna BIOSIS. We were all numb

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.150
and frozen. Just watching what was going

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.405
on.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.680
Then I received a message from Veronica

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.390
that people were working to secure the

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.485
archives.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.540
It was a wake up call that I was more or

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.910
less safe and now must take care of what

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.385
we can.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.420
We started talking quietly to people who

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.330
had chosen to stay in hockey. Those were

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.480
John broker and CO Alexey of poker zone

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.550
has a horrible love this love customers

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.165
choke and Alexander from them.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.710
We tried not to bring any attention to

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.840
where the archives were located and what

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.975
we were doing.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.100
volunteers gathered at the museum and

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.770
held back everything up. They also went

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.300
to other photographers and took their

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.240
private archives. And for a moment, the

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.460
museum turned into a spot to bring all

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.710
cultural stuff from around the city and

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.370
transported. I cannot even imagine what

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.770
level of courage you need to think about

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.265
art in this moment.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.970
In a situation of complete danger

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.990
People have different reactions, fight,

00:05:05.015 --> 00:05:07.115
freeze, or flight.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.690
These volunteers decided to completely

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.870
on biological reaction, they chose to

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.215
fight.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.090
They were incredibly brave. We own them

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.885
the whole security of the museum.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.255
They are our own personal heroes.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.590
Now I feel that not only photography but

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.780
art in general in Ukraine is in a very

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.825
tricky position.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.070
When you see all these photos of ruined

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.825
buildings of wounded and killed people,

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.550
you start asking yourself, What is this

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.045
for?

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.650
In these days of such extensive media

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.365
coverage, it risks losing weight.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.310
It is a huge challenge for our

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.800
photographers to find this language that

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.420
will manage to make people stop

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.500
scrolling and pause. That will give some

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.055
meaningful narration

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.690
but photography has the possibility to

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.650
use both aspects, creating a historical

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.620
document and adding an individual touch

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.695
to the message.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.090
And I believe this is the role of

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.999
photography now.

00:06:20.024 --> 00:06:39.523
